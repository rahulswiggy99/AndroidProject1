## Topics covered :- 
RecyclerView + MVVM + Retrofit with Coroutines + LiveData

## Basic Introduction
I have used MVVM architecture for creating a simple android application where I am getting the datas from this [link](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts) and showing ID and title in the format of a Recycler View (Adapter and View Holder).
For the getting the data here, I have used Retrofit followed by coroutines and sending the data into the Main Activity through the Live Data so that it can provide changes through observable and observers.
